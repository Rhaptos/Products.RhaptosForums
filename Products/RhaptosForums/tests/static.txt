Static Implementation Tests
===========================
 	
Let's just make sure that our static views are working as expected.
	
The first thing we need to do is to make sure the interfaces are
being correctly implemented::
 	
    >>> from Products.RhaptosForums.config import *
    >>> PROJECTNAME == 'RhaptosForums'
    True
    >>> SKINS_DIR == 'skins'
    True
